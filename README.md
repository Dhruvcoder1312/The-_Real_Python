The Real Python(Snake Game)
Welcome to the classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Pygame library! This project showcases the fundamentals of game development, including event handling, collision detection, and game state management.

Features
Classic Gameplay: Enjoy the traditional Snake game experience where the snake grows longer as it eats food.

Dynamic Movement: Control the snake using the arrow keys, navigating it through the game window.

Collision Detection: The game detects when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself, ending the game.

Random Food Placement: Food appears at random positions on the screen, challenging you to navigate the snake towards it.

Game Over Screen: Upon losing, players are presented with an option to quit or play again.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.

The objective is to eat the food (green squares) to grow longer.

Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.

Upon game over, you can press Q to quit or C to play again.
